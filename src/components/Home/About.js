          <p>Once upon of time a beautiful princess... Jajaja.</p>
          <p>What a nice story that could be... </p>
          <p>
            Jokes appart, I suppose if you are reading this, is because you want
            to know a little about me... an average girl from a beautiful
            Island, that I didnÂ´t get to apreciate until recent years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I know that I was in need of diversity, a way to scape the
            routine that dayly life impose on us.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started when I left Gran Canaria at the tender age of 23.
            With my head full of dreams, I wanted to travel the world, get to
            know different people from different cultures and different ways to
            look at live.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get to know another human being, the first step is to be able to
            comunicate... so I moved to London with one the goal. To learn
            English -the international language-
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeap that was the first step in a long journey... A one-way ticket
            and luggage full of illusions. Long story short... I stayed five
            years --plenty of memories and anecdotes-- sorry, I just got
            emotional remembering.
          </p>
          {/* <p>
            I studied an HND in Marketing and Advertising at the London School
            of Communication and there I had the chance to meet some wonderful
            people from all over the world. The City was surprisingly rich in
            world cuisine restaurants and it taught me how to be a good
            traveler. I learnt to save money while jumping from one place to
            another.
